# GreenhouseSprinklers

## Short Description
Greenhouse Sprinklers [SMAPI](https://smpai.io) mod.

Become friends with the Wizard and he'll send Robin some blueprints for you to upgrade your Greenhouse to have automatic sprinklers installed.

## Long Description

The Junimos are pleased with your contributions to the valley! After they rebuilt your greenhouse, they realized that they could improve it further. They want to make sure you can use the whole thing without using up spots for Sprinklers. They've told the Wizard these plans, and as you grow friendlier with him, he'll see their merit. He'll eventually tell Robin the plans, and send you a letter telling you the upgrade is available. 

There are 3 levels of upgrade that will unlock as you become more friendly with the Wizard: 

1. Installs Sprinklers on the ceiling of the greenhouse, will run every morning.
2. Upgrades the sprinklers on the ceiling, will now run every morning and evening.
3. Installs sprinklers all over the farm, hidden from view that will water everything morning and night
